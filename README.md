# Ping Pong Game
This is a simple ping pong game built with JavaScript, HTML, and SCSS.

#Installation
You need to have Python installed on your system to run the server. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

To check if you have Python installed, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python --version
# OR
python3 --version
You should see the Python version if you have it installed.
```
#Running the Game
To run the game, you need to start a HTTP server. You can do this with Python's built-in HTTP server.

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal:
```
cd ping-pong
```

#Start the server:
For Python 3, use:

```
python3 -m http.server
```
For Python 2, use:

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000. You should see the game running.
